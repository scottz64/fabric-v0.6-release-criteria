# Long Runs
Some tests are located in other directories where they must reside in order to be built and run.
To execute them, run bash scripts that can be found here. For example,
to run a 72-hour test using addrecs chaincode (which adds 1K payload to ledger with each invoke), simply execute run_long_run_72hour.sh
